<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a graduate of Gadjah Mada University, holding a degree in Electronics and
  Instrumentation. I have recently completed a bootcamp at Codemasters, where I
  acquired proficiency in React.js, Backend programming, and React Native. This
  experience has prompted my decision to transition into the field of
  Information Technology, driven by a genuine passion and commitment to further
  delve into this domain
